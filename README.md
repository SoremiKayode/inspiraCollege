1. open the index.html,

- wrap each image in the div with a class of 'product' around an anchor tag eg. create a page for the href of the anchor tag, copy the the code in 'singleProductPage.html' inside your new page. edit all the iamges and description to the image and description you get from ecommerce store like jumia and konga '<a href=""><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Product 3"></a'

- change the href of all the anchor tag inside the nav component to scroll to the required section of the page eg for this link <a href="#">Fashion</a> i will add an id to the fashion container like this
'<div class="container" id='fashion'>'
'<h2 class="section-title">Fashion</h2>'
Then i will use the fashion on the link like this '<a href="#fashion">Fashion</a>'
